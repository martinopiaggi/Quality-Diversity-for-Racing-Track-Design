README for trackexporter
by Jacopo Sirianni


This bot extracts parts of the track data structures outside Torcs.
It takes data from the tTrack passed to the bot and exports them to ~/.torcs/tracks/trackName.csv.
This bot automatically retires as soon as it joins the race.
The data exported can be customized modifying the initTrack() method in trackexporter.cpp.



Made for Torcs 1.3.6
